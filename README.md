### My Vimrc

While at Makers Academy I moved from using Sublime Text to Vim. I was attracted to the purely terminal-based workflow and the precision which vim encourages you to have when making changes to a codebase.

I began my VIM journey with [vim-adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/), a colourful game that teaches vim commands. It allowed me to build
up the muscle memory necessary for using vim effectively without the frustration of having to do it through a real coding project.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning vim. =)  
  
*I made the mistake* at the outset of copying someone else's vimrc file. This meant I had a lot of plugins and bindings that I didn't really understand. I currently have a situation where my .vimrc includes some stuff from someone else's that I'm unsure about any bindings etc added by me.  
  
### Key Bindings
*Arrow keys* It's common practice among Makers students who use vim to disable the arrow-key bindings obliging you to learn the more efficient home-key navigation bindings. I recently rebound the arrow keys to allow directional switching of windows:

*first non-space character / end of line* I rebound shift-h and shift-l to allow me to move quickly to the first character
of a line and the end of a line.

###To do
- Explore window-management methods/plugins, as this is something I still struggle with.
- Find a nice colour scheme.
